# CSGO-Newbie-Guide
A medium length repo for helping new players get into CSGO.

Here are some links that might help with learning the game itself. As you play, make friends and add the people that you work well with. I would also look into the subreddit discord in the /go subreddit sidebar. That might help get you started too!

**Basic Mechanics**

* [TheWarOwl - How does recoil work in CS:GO](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=octRQYnnuig)

* [TheWarOwl - How to Practice Recoil Control](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvA5LO-CtOY)

* [TheWarOwl - CS:GO Economy Guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DpXtRbggpQM)


**Helpful Resources**

* [Smokes / Flashes / Molly's](http://sothatwemaybefree.com/) - Sothatwemaybefree has a really nice site showing common throws.

* [Aim Training Theory](https://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensive/comments/3anjtd/how_to_train_your_aim_by_the_16_yo_semipro/) 

* [Crosshair Generator by Crashz, this is used to customize your crosshair](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=308490450&searchtext=Crosshair+Generator)

* [CSGO Demo Manager](https://csgo-demos-manager.com/)

* YouTube - [adreN](https://www.youtube.com/user/CurseCS/videos), [warowl](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRLVloYyf9k&list=PLHF999pjo89Nu55Ep1Y0UHHLKluF5c-IK), [steel](https://www.youtube.com/user/JoshNissanCS/videos)

* LuckySkillFaker also has a great series called [Noob to Pro](https://m.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLfIyu2flKmBCTgQdmDH0fiZUaagB4rD0_), which can help you take the process step by step (which is pretty in-depth and provides routines to help build muscle memory and be able to retain your skills).

**Movement**

* LuckySkillfaker [Basic Movement](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVFgi--IOcI)

* LuckySkillFaker [Advanced Movement](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjVCdnwVgxo)

* Make sure that you understand there's more to movement than the generic "kz, bhop, and surfing", since peeking even has its own styles to that involve counterstrafing, which is essential to understand when playing. Remember it takes a lot of time to grasp and master, so have patience and it'll pay off in the end!

**Workshop Help**

There are also tons of useful workshop maps that you can subscribe to through the steam workshop, which can provide ways to warmup, learn maps, and practice new skills.

* [Aim_botz](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=243702660) by Mr. uLLeticaL™-S-. This one is commonly used to warmup, as well as for practicing new skills with the options it provides you (moving bots, peek boxes, long range, uneven ground, etc.)

* [YPrac Maps](https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=740795413) by Yesber. These are the multi-purpose maps that allow you to learn the common angles people will hold on each map, as well as grenade lineups, a neat way to find your own, and other miscellaneous things.
