# **CS:GO-Newbie-Guide**

Here is some information that might help with learning the game itself. I would also consider joining the discord of the /r/GlobalOffensive subreddit, which you can find on the sidebar. That might help get you started too!

As you play CS and make friends, add the people that you work well with on Steam. This will give you a stable of positive, potential teammates to draw from on your friends list, instead of getting random players assigned to you in matchmaking. 

**Basic Mechanics**

* [TheWarOwl - How to Practice Recoil Control](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvA5LO-CtOY)

* [TheWarOwl - CS:GO Economy Guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DpXtRbggpQM) (The only thing that doesn't apply anymore from this video, is the loss round bonus money. Here is the updated version of the loss bonus -->) [TheWarOwl - Meta Change w/Loss Round Bonus](https://youtu.be/AJwiFID3IdU?t=54)

**Movement**

* LuckySkillfaker - [Basic Movement](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVFgi--IOcI) & [Advanced Movement](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjVCdnwVgxo)

* TheWarOwl - [CS:GO Movement Guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGcgQEzCCrI)

* Make sure that you understand there's more to movement than the generic "kz, bhop, and surfing", since peeking even has its own methods (wide/shoulder/jiggle peeks) that involve counterstrafing, which is essential to understand when elevating your game. Remember it takes a lot of time to grasp and master, so have patience and it'll pay off in the end!

**Helpful Resources**

* [Smokes / Flashes / Molly's](http://sothatwemaybefree.com/) - Sothatwemaybefree has a really nice site showing common throws for both 64 and 128 tick servers (Valve Matchmaking & External Services).

* [Aim Training Theory](https://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensive/comments/3anjtd/how_to_train_your_aim_by_the_16_yo_semipro/) - From the mind of a semi pro.

* [Config Generator by Crashz'](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1325659427) - This is used to create a config file that saves all of your settings and binds. It also has features of the two maps below, being able to customize your Crosshair and Viewmodel.

* [Crosshair Generator by Crashz'](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=308490450) - This is used to customize your crosshair. This map also provides Professional Players & Streamers' crosshairs if you want to test theirs out.

* [Viewmodel Generator by Crashz'](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=365126929) - This is used to customize your viewmodel.

* [CSGO Demo Manager](https://csgo-demos-manager.com/) - One place to analyze your demos and review beyond the time that Valve stores the demos.

* YouTube - [adreN](https://www.youtube.com/user/CurseCS/videos), [TheWarOwl](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRLVloYyf9k&list=PLHF999pjo89Nu55Ep1Y0UHHLKluF5c-IK), [steel](https://www.youtube.com/user/JoshNissanCS/videos), [voo CSGO](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2vjGuOTH-KcRCLSm5F3oUA), [3kliksphilip](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLfwtcDG7LpxGeQUBNIQHTNsSBrjzi2jX0) (He also has very informational videos regarding other aspects of the game), [BananaGaming](https://www.youtube.com/user/OfficialBananaGamers) (Makes update videos a lot too, helps with knowing what changes are made in the game), [n0thing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3jAOcjIBfk&list=PL60ZobTZpb7KSTs99Y9XZKbL5UM3CkD3R) (While some of his content may pertain to the questions of more experienced CS players, he has an array of informational videos, and is very open with explaining his thought process behind actions within the game).

* LuckySkillFaker also has a great series called [Noob to Pro](https://m.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLfIyu2flKmBCTgQdmDH0fiZUaagB4rD0_), which can help you take the process step by step (which is pretty in-depth and provides routines to help build muscle memory and be able to retain your skills).

**Workshop Help**

There are also tons of useful workshop maps that you can subscribe to through the steam workshop, which can provide ways to warmup, learn maps, and practice new skills.

* [Aim_botz](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=243702660) by Mr. uLLeticaLâ„¢-S-. This one is commonly used to warmup, as well as for practicing new skills with the options it provides you (moving bots, peek boxes, long range, uneven ground, etc.)

* [YPrac Maps](https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=740795413) by Yesber. These are the multi-purpose maps that allow you to learn the common angles people will hold on each map, as well as grenade lineups, a neat way to find your own, and other miscellaneous things.

**Other**

If you're having difficulties pinpointing bad habits you may have developed, or you'd like some feedback about your gameplay, the r/csgocritic subreddit may be useful. There, you can submit one of your matches to be analyzed by other community members. TheOnlyBarker has done analyses there many times, so feel free to send him a PM if you want a match to be looked at.

* n0thing, a long time professional player, has also released [a paid guide on udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/counter-strike-global-offensive-play-like-a-pro/) that goes over many facets of the game, and has 3 hours worth of information (is $15; you can find the discount code on his Twitch if the "sale" ever goes off. [This link is directly from his stream](https://www.udemy.com/counter-strike-global-offensive-play-like-a-pro/?couponCode=TWITCH999)).

* Sometimes you will learn best by sitting back and watching those that are more experienced than you, which can be done by watching professional matches/some selective streamers (n0thing, autimatic, flusha, those who do not go exclusively for flashy plays). Although it may be complex to understand their decisionmaking, focusing on one thing at a time, and trying to incorporate it into your play may prove to be benficial. For example, a rudimentary skill is crosshair placement, which can be seen at nearly every second of play.

* At the end of it all, make sure that you're still having fun, and focusing on things one step at a time. We can get ahead of ourselves, treating the game like our lives depend on it. Being carefree from time to time and enjoying fun workshop maps can allow your overall experience with the game to be better than you could've ever imagined. Have fun, and remember that the process is very long, but worth it if you treat it correctly.
