# CSGO-Newbie-Guide

Here are some links that might help with learning the game itself. I would also consider joining the discord of the /r/GlobalOffensive subreddit, which you can find on the sidebar. That might help get you started too!

As you play CS and make friends, add the people that you work well with on Steam. This will give you a stable of positive, potential teammates to draw from on your friends list instead of getting random players assigned to you in matchmaking. 

**Basic Mechanics**

* [TheWarOwl - How does recoil work in CS:GO](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=octRQYnnuig)

* [TheWarOwl - How to Practice Recoil Control](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvA5LO-CtOY)

* [TheWarOwl - CS:GO Economy Guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DpXtRbggpQM)

**Movement**

* LuckySkillfaker - [Basic Movement](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVFgi--IOcI) & [Advanced Movement](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjVCdnwVgxo)

* TheWarOwl - [CS:GO Movement Guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGcgQEzCCrI)

* Make sure that you understand there's more to movement than the generic "kz, bhop, and surfing", since peeking even has its own methods (wide/shoulder/jiggle peeks) that involve counterstrafing, which is essential to understand when elevating your game. Remember it takes a lot of time to grasp and master, so have patience and it'll pay off in the end!

**Helpful Resources**

* [Smokes / Flashes / Molly's](http://sothatwemaybefree.com/) - Sothatwemaybefree has a really nice site showing common throws for both 64 and 128 tick servers (Valve Matchmaking & External Services).

* [Aim Training Theory](https://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensive/comments/3anjtd/how_to_train_your_aim_by_the_16_yo_semipro/) - From the mind of a semi pro.

* [Crosshair Generator by Crashz'](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=308490450&searchtext=Crosshair+Generator) - This is used to customize your crosshair

* [CSGO Demo Manager](https://csgo-demos-manager.com/) - One place to analyze your demos and review beyond the time that Valve stores the demos.

* YouTube - [adreN](https://www.youtube.com/user/CurseCS/videos), [TheWarOwl](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRLVloYyf9k&list=PLHF999pjo89Nu55Ep1Y0UHHLKluF5c-IK), [steel](https://www.youtube.com/user/JoshNissanCS/videos), [voo CSGO](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2vjGuOTH-KcRCLSm5F3oUA), [3kliksphilip](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLfwtcDG7LpxGeQUBNIQHTNsSBrjzi2jX0) (He also has very informational videos regarding other aspects of the game)

* LuckySkillFaker also has a great series called [Noob to Pro](https://m.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLfIyu2flKmBCTgQdmDH0fiZUaagB4rD0_), which can help you take the process step by step (which is pretty in-depth and provides routines to help build muscle memory and be able to retain your skills).

**Workshop Help**

There are also tons of useful workshop maps that you can subscribe to through the steam workshop, which can provide ways to warmup, learn maps, and practice new skills.

* [Aim_botz](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=243702660) by Mr. uLLeticaLâ„¢-S-. This one is commonly used to warmup, as well as for practicing new skills with the options it provides you (moving bots, peek boxes, long range, uneven ground, etc.)

* [YPrac Maps](https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=740795413) by Yesber. These are the multi-purpose maps that allow you to learn the common angles people will hold on each map, as well as grenade lineups, a neat way to find your own, and other miscellaneous things.
