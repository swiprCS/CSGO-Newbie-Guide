# **CS:GO-Newbie-Guide**

Here is some information that might help with learning the game itself. I would consider joining the discord of the /r/GlobalOffensive subreddit, which you can find on the sidebar. As you play CS and make friends, add the people that you work well with on Steam. This will give you a stable of positive, potential teammates to draw from on your friends list, instead of getting random players assigned to you in matchmaking.

**Workshop Help**

There are also tons of useful workshop maps that you can subscribe to through the steam workshop, which can provide ways to warmup, learn maps, and practice new skills.

* [Aim_botz](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=243702660) by Mr. uLLeticaLâ„¢-S-. This one is commonly used to warmup, as well as for practicing new skills with the options it provides you (moving bots, peek boxes, long range, uneven ground, etc.)

* [YPrac Maps](https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=740795413) by Yesber. These are the multi-purpose maps that allow you to learn the common angles people will hold on each map, as well as grenade lineups, a neat way to find your own, and other miscellaneous things.

**Alternative Matchmaking**

If you have any goals of playing more serious, you should look into joining and playing in the Mythic League Hubs.
